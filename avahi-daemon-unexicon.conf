# allow-interfaces - comma separated list of allowed network interfaces that

# add-service-cookie - When set to 'yes' an implicit TXT entry will be added

# publish-dns-servers - Comma separated list of IP addresses for unicast DNS
# servers.  You can use this to announce unicast DNS servers via mDNS.  When
# used in conjunction with avahi-dnsconfd on the client side this allows
# DHCP-like configuration of unicast DNS servers.  ****NOTE**** we cannot
# publish these unless they are really here; so, this needs to be updated by
# hook script.  **** NOTE **** DO NOT DO THIS.  Most distros have
# avahi-dnsconfd services enabled and are not well prepared to handle this

[reflector]
# enable-reflector - If set to yes avahi-daemon will reflect incoming mDNS
# requests to all local network interfaces, effectively allowing clients to
# browse mDNS/DNS-SD services on all networks connected to the gateway.  Make
# sure not to run multiple reflectors between the same networks, this might
# cause them to play Ping Pong with mDNS packets.  Defaults to no.
## We should enable refectors on the VPN gateway, so if we have configured a
## VPN gateway address, we should set this to 'yes' and reload avahi.
#enable-reflector=no
# reflect-ipv - when 'yes' and enable-reflector is 'yes', forward mDNS traffic
# between IPv4 and IPv6, which is usually not recommended.  Defaults to 'no'.
