# Undisciplined Local Clock.  This is a fake driver intended for backup
# and when no outside source of synchronized time is available.  The
# default stratum is usually 3, bit in this case we elect to use stratum
# 0.  Since the server line does not have the prefer keyword, this
# driver is never used for synchronization, unless no other
# synchronization source is available.  In cas the local host is
# controlled by some external source, such as an external oscillator or
# another protocol, the prefer keyword would cause the local host to
# disregard all other synchronization sources, unless the kernel
# modifications are in use and declare an unsynchronized condition.
#
# Each NTP server will freewheel on its own local clock when it can
# communicate with no servers or peers.

# --- BROADCAST SERVER ---
#
# For type b and m addresses (only), this comman mobilizes a persistent
# broadcast mode association.  Multiple commands can be used to specify
# multiple local broadcast interfaces (subnets) and/or multiple multicast
# groups.  Note that local broadcast messages go only to the interface
# associated witht he subnet specified, but multicast messages go to
# all interfaces.
#
# In broadcast mode, the local server sends periodic broadcast mesages
# to a client population at the address specified, which is usually the
# broadcast address on (one of) the local network(s) or a multicast
# address assigned to NTP.  The IANA has assigned the multicast group
# address IPv4 224.0.1.1 and IPv6 ff05::101 (site local) exclusively to
# NTP, but other nonconflicting addresses can be used to contain the
# messages within adminstrative boundaries.  Ordinarily, this
# specification applies only to the local server operating as a sender;
# for operation as a broadcast client, see the broadcastclient or
# mutlicast client commands.
#
# Need to block 224.0.1.1 off of external interfaces (and
# possibly VPN interfaces) in both directions when this is
# not commented out.  In face we should block 224.0.1.1 On
# any interface that has a defined default route (whether
# we are using it or not).

multicastclient	224.0.1.1
#
# Note: I use a dhcp hook script to add a new broadcast subnet to the
# ntpd each time an interface comes up (provided that the subnet is
# local) and to remove one when the interface goes down.  That way the
# ntpd will broadcast on all local nets.
